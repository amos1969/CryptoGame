Bl1a:Hi! My name is Bin… Just call me B. As you can hear I have a speech impediment. But you can speak normally with me, don't worry. I hope that's not a problem. Can you understand me?
0l1q:(yes / No, I can't understand you):
0l2no:If you have difficulties understanding this guy with a speech impediment, try checking out the library.
Bl2yes:Great! You seem like a bright person. What's your name?
Bl2tb:My name is
Bl3a:Nice to meet you
Bl3b:You don't know how glad I am to finally meet a normal speaking person again. As you can probably tell I'm not from Bi-Town, I was just shut away here because nobody could understand me. Not even Alice… Life can be cruel, can't it. But when I speak Bi-language nobody can understand me either! So nobody wil help me get the ingredients for the antidote I need.
0l3answer:I say! I could lend you a hand, if you like.
Bl4:You would? Now that would be amazing! I'm sure I'll find a way to recompensate for your troubles.
Bl5a:Hey, it's you again. I feel so lonely here. Do you think you could hurry up a bit? Maybe you can find some information in the library.
